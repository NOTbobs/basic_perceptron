# Basic Perceptron
Perceptron using old school update.

Basic Perceptron. Used lecture notes from: https://www.cs.utah.edu/~zhe/pdf/lec-10-perceptron-upload.pdf

Can only classify things that are linearly separable, https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2018fa/lectures/lecturenote03.html

At this time backprop, and grad descent did not exist. Activation function was sign(Wx)

Implementation could be more elegant, but the conditional statements in the update function is there to show that updates only occur on misclassifications. 

Apparently these kinds of perceptrons lead to the AI winter?
